# Heart Disease Classification

This project focuses on the classification of heart disease using machine learning algorithms. Heart disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, making accurate and timely diagnosis crucial for effective treatment and prevention. By leveraging a dataset containing various patient attributes and diagnostic information, this project aims to develop predictive models capable of accurately identifying individuals with heart disease based on their clinical characteristics.

## DataSet
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.

## Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The preprocessing and EDA phase involves cleaning and exploring the dataset to gain insights into the data's structure and characteristics. This phase includes tasks such as:

Handling missing values.
Removing duplicate entries.
Data type conversion and standardization.
Exploring the distribution of features and target variable.
Identifying outliers and visualizing feature correlations.
## Model Building and Evaluation

The main objective of this project is to develop accurate predictive models for heart disease classification. Several machine learning algorithms are employed, including:

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)
Decision Tree Classifier
The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and each model is trained using the training data. Performance evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, confusion matrix, and ROC curve are utilized to assess the models' effectiveness in predicting heart disease.
## Result and conclusion 

The results obtained from the trained models are analyzed and compared to determine the most effective algorithm for heart disease classification. Additionally, feature importance analysis is conducted to identify the key predictors of heart disease. The findings of this project provide valuable insights into the application of machine learning techniques in healthcare and contribute to the development of accurate diagnostic tools for heart disease detection and management.
